## üíπ Dependencies

- **[boii_utils v2.0 or above](https://github.com/boiidevelopment/boii_utils/releases/tag/v2.0.0)**

---

## üì¶ Getting Started

Prior to installation make sure you have all of the dependencies listed above in your server and you have completed their setup steps in full.

1. Configuration:

Some options have a dedicated config section, you should adjust these to your requirements.
The `config.lua` contains a short notes section with some links to useful information that can help you adjust the resource to make it more personal.

2. UI Customisation: 

If you want to change the UI colour palette you can do do so here: `ui/css/root.css`
The menu uses these root colours however the canvas telemtry elements you can edit those within the constructors of each class. 

3. Resource Installation:

Since this is standalone it is just a drag and drop resource;

- After customising config add the resource into your server resources
- Type `refresh; ensure boii_vehiclemenu` into the console and you should be ready to go. 
- Or restart your server.

## üì¶ Usage

1. Opening The Menu:

By default players can press `j` to open the vehicle menu, this can be done outside of a vehicle incase it needs to be closed however all actions must be performed by the driver.
You can change the default keymapping to toggle the menu in the `config.lua`.

The menu then has 2 relevant buttons; `CLOSE`, `TOGGLE FOCUS`
You can use `CLOSE` to close **only** the menu, this will leave any telemetry elements visible.
You can use `TOGGLE FOCUS` to toggle Nui focus leaving the menu on screen but enabling full movement -- push `j` to toggle focus back on.

2. UI Dragging: 

All of the included elements can be dragged to moved and positions will be saved locally.

Moveable Elements:
- Menu
- G-Meter
- Wheel Telemetry
- Vehicle Telemetry

3. Advanced Customisation: 

The resource comes with a event method registry.
This allows you to export into the resource externally to create and attach custom methods the the events used throughout.

For Example:

```lua
--- Registering an event method.
exports.boii_vehiclemenu:add_method('toggle_autopilot', function(response)
    local vehicle = response.vehicle -- Response options; 'source', 'player', 'vehicle', 'is_active'

    if GetVehicleClass(vehicle) == 8 then
        return false
    end
end)

--- Removing a registered method.
exports.boii_vehiclemenu:remove_method('toggle_autopilot')
```

## üìù Notes

- Updated documentation for all resources is currently being worked on however none currently exists. This will be completed a.s.a.p, however it should not be required for this resource.
- Game build 3258+ is required for enabling some options on only electric vehicles. If you are on a lower gamebuild they will default to avaiable for none electric.
- Have some additional plans to add to this in future updates to cover telemetry for other vehicle type, planes, boats etc.

## ü§ù Suggestions

Suggestions for changes or additional things to add into resources are always welcome. 
If you have an idea for something you think a resource could include, should include, could be handled differently or anything inbetween, just reach out through discord.
